# misc
This directory contains several small python routines that were written to analyse non-work related data, such as the FIFA19 players database, some mountain-bike race ranking, or nutritional values of meals. 


## fifa19
Analyse the FIFA19 players database to answer some key questions as a coach, or a scout.

## ranking_winningtime
Read the ranking data from the winningtime website as a .csv file and plot some interesting information (Position vs time, Time vs age, etc).

## nutval
Read a table containing the ingredients of daily meals and compare them with a nutritional values ingredient database (here "carte_nutritionnelle_cal_8200_aliments.csv") to compute the meal nutritional values.
